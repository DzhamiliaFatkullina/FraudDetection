# Fraud Detection Model Report  

## Current Progress  
We have developed a fraud detection model using **RandomForestClassifier**, trained on transaction and identity data. The preprocessing pipeline includes feature scaling and encoding, and the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## Planned Improvements  
- **Feature Engineering**: Improve handling of missing values, remove redundant features, and incorporate time-based patterns.  
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with **XGBoost/LightGBM**, fine-tune hyperparameters, and explore ensemble methods.  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implement **SMOTE** and cost-sensitive learning to improve fraud detection rates.  
- **Deployment Enhancements**: Save the model for reuse, integrate real-time fraud detection via **Flask/FastAPI**, and add logging for better monitoring.  

These enhancements will improve the modelâ€™s accuracy, efficiency, and real-world applicability.
