# Transaction Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning and nature-inspired computing techniques. It applies models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM, optimized using Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

## Methodology
- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, feature engineering, and selection.
- **ML Models**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM.
- **Optimization**: GA & PSO for hyperparameter tuning.
